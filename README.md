# Apache-Maven
<h2>What is Apache Maven?</h2>
<br>
<p>Apache Maven is a build automation tool primarily used for Java projects. It is designed to simplify the build process, dependency management, and project deployment. It follows a convention-over-configuration approach, making it easy for developers to define project structure and build configurations. Maven is commonly used in large-scale software development to manage builds, dependencies, and documentation.</p>
<br>
<h3>Key Features of Apache Maven:</h3>
<br>
<h4>Project Object Model (POM):</h4>
<br>
<p>Maven uses a central configuration file called pom.xml (Project Object Model) to manage project settings, dependencies, plugins, and other configurations.</p>
<p>This file defines how the project is built, what dependencies are required, and which plugins should be used for tasks such as compiling, testing, packaging, and deploying the project. </p>
<h4>Dependency Management:</h4>

<p>Maven automatically handles the downloading and management of project dependencies from central repositories (such as Maven Central).</p>
<br>
<p>You specify dependencies in the pom.xml file, and Maven fetches the required libraries, saving developers from manually downloading and configuring them.</p>
<h4>Build Automation:</h4>

<p>Maven automates repetitive tasks in the software build process, such as compiling code, running tests, generating JAR/WAR files, packaging, and deploying.
You can use Maven commands like mvn compile, mvn test, mvn install, and mvn deploy to automate these processes.</p>
<h4>Standardized Project Structure:</h4>

<p>Maven promotes a standard directory structure that all projects follow, making it easier for developers to switch between projects and maintain consistency in build processes.</p>
<br>
<p>A typical Maven project structure includes directories like src/main/java, src/
test/java, src/main/resources, and target.</p>
<br>
<p>Plugin Ecosystem:</h4>
<br>
<p>Maven has a rich plugin ecosystem that provides tools for additional tasks like code analysis, code coverage, documentation generation, and packaging.
Popular plugins include Surefire (for running tests), Assembly (for creating distribution packages), and Javadoc (for generating documentation).</p>
<br>
<h4>Multi-module Support:</h4>
<br>
<p>Maven supports multi-module projects, where several related sub-projects (modules) can be managed and built together.
The parent POM defines common configurations for all modules, and each module has its own sub-POM.</p>
<h4>Repositories:</h4>
<br>
<p>Maven uses repositories to store project dependencies. There are two types of repositories:<p>
<h5>Local Repository:</h5> A local cache where Maven stores downloaded dependencies.
<h5>Remote Repository:</h5> A remote server (like Maven Central) that stores and distributes libraries.
You can configure Maven to work with multiple repositories, including custom ones for internal libraries.
<h4>Extensibility:</h4>

<p>Maven allows developers to extend its functionality by creating custom plugins or by modifying the pom.xml to add custom build steps or configure existing ones.</p>
